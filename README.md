## üìñ About This Project

This project predicts the power output for a combined cycle power plant using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). It includes everything you need: data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and result visualization. With this tool, you can analyze your data and understand how different factors influence power output.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use this application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Software:** Click the link below to access the Releases page where you can download the application.

   [Download the Application](https://github.com/cinnamonscented-nucleoside378/power-output-prediction-ann/releases)

2. **Extract the Files:** After downloading, locate the file and extract it to a folder of your choice. You can use any extraction tool.

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:** Inside the folder, you will find a Jupyter Notebook file. Open this file in Jupyter Notebook. If you do not have Jupyter installed, you can download it via Anaconda or other installation options.

4. **Run the Notebook:** Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your data, run the model, and visualize your results.

## üé• Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean your data easily before using it for predictions.
- **Model Training:** Train the ANN model with your choice of parameters.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Understand how well your model predicts power output.
- **Result Visualization:** View your results in clear graphs for better insights.

## üìã System Requirements

To run this software, you need the following:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- Jupyter Notebook or Anaconda.
- The following Python libraries installed:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - TensorFlow or Keras

## üîß Installation Instructions

1. **Install Python:** Download and install Python from the official website. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your PATH.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** You can launch Jupyter Notebook by running this command in your command prompt or terminal:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook:** Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files and click on the Jupyter Notebook file to open it.

## üí° Usage Guide

1. **Load Your Data:**
   After opening the notebook, locate the cell that loads your dataset. Change the file path in the code to your actual data file.

2. **Run Each Cell:**
   Click "Run" for each code cell in the notebook. This will process your data, train the model, and generate visualizations.

3. **View Results:**
   At the end of the notebook, you will see graphs that show your model's performance. Analyze these to understand the prediction accuracy.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you experience issues:

- Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- Check that you have the correct version of Python.
- Review the notebook for any missing or incorrect paths.
